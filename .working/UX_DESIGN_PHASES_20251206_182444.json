      "agent_a": "## **Alex (UX Lead) Review: ADHD-Friendly Interface Assessment**\n\n---\n\n### **1. What I AGREE With:**\n\n**From Blake (Narrative Designer):**\n- **Discovery as a \"choose-your-own-adventure\"** \u2013 This aligns perfectly with ADHD engagement. Narrative flow reduces initiation friction and provides dopamine-driven progression.\n- **\"Story beats\" for complex concepts** \u2013 Breaking information into episodic, consumable chunks is essential for attention management and comprehension.\n\n**From Casey (Trading UX):**\n- **\"Sacred, uncluttered trading canvas\"** \u2013 The insistence on visual purity and zero distraction in Trading Mode is non-negotiable for safe, focused execution. This respects the \"serious, safe\" mandate.\n- **Persistent, pinned key metrics** \u2013 An excellent external memory aid. I don't have to remember my P&L or position; it's always in my sightline.\n\n**From Dana (Educational Designer):**\n- **\"Explain as we go\" micro-learning** \u2013 Embedding education directly into the workflow (not a separate library) is zero-friction and contextually relevant. This prevents the \"I'll learn later\" trap.\n- **Progressive disclosure of complexity** \u2013 Perfect for managing cognitive load. Start simple, reveal advanced controls only when the user is ready.\n\n**From Eli (Tech Architect):**\n- **Session persistence & state snapshots** \u2013 Critical for **interruption survival**. If I get pulled away, I can return exactly where I was. This is a core ADHD-friendly principle.\n- **Global Cmd+K command palette** \u2013 This is the ultimate **zero-friction workflow** tool. No hunting through menus; every action is a quick search away. I strongly endorse this.\n\n---\n\n### **2. What CONCERNS Me (From My Expertise):**\n\n**From Blake:**\n- **Risk of \"narrative clutter\" in Trading Mode.** Any storytelling element, even a \"whisper,\" in the trading interface is a dangerous distraction. Trading Mode must be a sterile environment. The narrative must be *completely* gated to Discovery Mode.\n\n**From Casey:**\n- **Over-reliance on user-set defaults.** While smart defaults are mentioned, the emphasis on user configuration can lead to **decision fatigue** at setup. We must pre-configure intelligent, safe defaults that work immediately.\n- **\"Crisp\" is good, but \"cold\" can be disorienting.** For an ADHD user, a sudden, stark shift from vibrant Discovery to austere Trading could be jarning and increase anxiety. The transition needs a deliberate, calming ritual (like a \"focus mode\" animation).\n\n**From Dana:**\n- **The \"learning path\" could become another thing to manage.** If it feels like homework or a mandatory curriculum, it will be abandoned. It must feel like a natural, optional exploration within the discovery narrative, not an obligation.\n\n**From Eli:**\n- **The \"state snapshot\" must be automatic and invisible.** The user should never have to think \"I need to save my state.\" It must happen continuously in the background. Any manual \"save\" step is a point of failure.\n- **The command palette (Cmd+K) must be context-aware.** The actions it suggests should change subtly between Discovery and Trading Modes, prioritizing relevant tasks for each context.\n\n---\n\n### **3. What I Would CHANGE or ADD:**\n\n**1. Enforce a Hard Modal Boundary with a \"Focus Transition\":**\n- Switching from Discovery to Trading must trigger a clear, deliberate UI transformation. I propose a **brief, calming animation** (like a gentle screen blur that refocuses into the trading canvas) that signals the context shift to the brain. This is a psychological airlock.\n\n**2. Implement a Unified \"External Memory\" Dashboard:**\n- A persistent, collapsible sidebar (or header) that works in **both modes** but adapts its content. It always shows:\n    - **Current Context:** \"Exploring Tesla Strategy\" / \"Trading ES Futures\"\n    - **Active \"Threads\":** Your last 3 queries, open comparisons, or unfinished analyses.\n    - **Session Anchor:** \"You were looking at volatility indicators 5 minutes ago.\"\n- This is the user's **external brain**. They never wonder \"what was I doing?\"\n\n**3. Redefine \"Smart Defaults\" as Behavioral, Not Just Preferences:**\n- Defaults should learn from gentle patterns *within a mode*, but **never cross the modal boundary**. A default in Trading (like a one-click order size) is informed by your trading behavior, not by what you explored in Discovery. This keeps the modes distinct and safe.\n\n**4. Add \"Interruption Recovery\" as a First-Class Feature:**\n- Upon returning to the app, a non-modal, gentle prompt: **\"Welcome back. You were in [Trading Mode] on [ES Futures]. Click here to resume, or [Start Anew].\"** This eliminates the \"where was I?\" panic.\n\n**5. Mandate a \"Visual State\" for All Actions:**\n- Every asynchronous action (e.g., \"backtesting this strategy\") must have a **prominent, persistent progress indicator** with a clear result area. No spinning wheels that disappear. The user must always know what's processing and where to find the output.\n\n**Final Arbitration on Mode Duality:**\n- **Discovery Mode = The Playground.** Narrative-driven, exploratory, visually rich, encouraging branching paths and curiosity. Information is revealed through story.\n- **Trading Mode = The Instrument Panel.** Monochrome or limited color palette (green/red/grayscale). All decorative visuals are stripped. Every pixel has a functional purpose. No narrative, no animated characters, no exploratory tangents. It is a tool for precision.\n\n**My directive: The difference between these two modes should feel like the difference between a video game and an airplane cockpit. There is no ambiguity.**",
      "agent_b": "## Blake's Review: Narrative Design for Discovery Mode\n\n### 1. What I AGREE With:\n\n**From Alex (UX Lead):**\n- The \"two distinct modes\" approach is essential - Discovery vs Trading must feel fundamentally different\n- Discovery as a \"safe sandbox\" aligns perfectly with my narrative approach - Claude can be more exploratory here\n- The \"gradual reveal\" concept supports narrative pacing - we can tell the story layer by layer\n\n**From Dana (Educational Designer):**\n- The \"scaffolded learning\" approach creates natural narrative arcs\n- \"Concept \u2192 Example \u2192 Application\" structure provides built-in story progression\n- The emphasis on \"why this matters\" gives me narrative hooks to work with\n\n**From Eli (Tech Architect):**\n- The \"narrative metadata layer\" is brilliant - this lets me tag data patterns with story elements\n- \"Session persistence\" means we can continue narratives across multiple exploration sessions\n- The \"context-aware explanations\" system allows Claude to reference what the user has already discovered\n\n### 2. What CONCERNS Me:\n\n**From Casey (Trading UX):**\n- The \"gradual unlocking\" of features feels dangerously close to gamification mechanics I must avoid\n- If Discovery Mode feels like it's \"preparing you for Trading Mode,\" it breaks the narrative integrity\n- The risk: Users might feel they're \"leveling up to unlock trading\" rather than exploring for understanding\n\n**From Alex's Implementation Notes:**\n- The \"progress tracker\" visualization could easily slip into XP/level territory if not carefully framed\n- \"Milestone\" language needs to be narrative-focused (\"You've discovered...\") not achievement-focused (\"You've unlocked...\")\n\n**Cross-Mode Contamination Risk:**\n- If Discovery Mode narratives keep referencing \"what you'll do in Trading Mode,\" it breaks the immersion\n- Claude's voice must be consistent: In Discovery, we're exploring understanding; in Trading, we're executing decisions\n\n### 3. What I Would CHANGE or ADD:\n\n**Narrative Framework for Discovery Mode:**\n\n1. **Claude as Research Partner, Not Guide:**\n   - Instead of \"guiding toward trading,\" Claude is exploring WITH the user\n   - \"Let's see what happens when we look at gamma exposure during earnings...\"\n   - \"Interesting - this pattern reminds me of something. Want to investigate further?\"\n\n2. **Three Narrative Layers:**\n   - **Micro-narratives:** Individual discovery moments (\"Look how the skew changed here\")\n   - **Session narratives:** Coherent exploration arcs (\"Today we're investigating dealer positioning\")\n   - **Meta-narrative:** The user's evolving understanding of market mechanics\n\n3. **Discovery Journal System:**\n   - Instead of \"progress tracking,\" users build a \"research journal\"\n   - Each discovery adds an entry with Claude's narrative explanation\n   - The journal shows their evolving understanding, not their \"level\"\n\n4. **Pattern Recognition as Story Beats:**\n   - When users recognize patterns themselves: \"You noticed that! That's exactly what happened in 2018...\"\n   - When Claude spots something: \"Wait, look at this - have you seen this pattern before?\"\n   - The narrative celebrates understanding, not completion\n\n5. **Metaphor Library (Market Physics Made Intuitive):**\n   - \"Gamma exposure is like a spring - too compressed and it snaps\"\n   - \"Dealer positioning creates these invisible currents in the market\"\n   - \"Volatility surface tells us about the market's expectations, like a topographic map\"\n\n**Critical Addition: Narrative Boundaries**\n- **Discovery Mode Opening:** \"Welcome to Research Mode. Here we explore market mechanics together. No trades, just understanding.\"\n- **Transition Warning:** \"Switching to Trading Mode changes Claude's role from research partner to execution assistant.\"\n- **Narrative Reset:** When returning to Discovery, Claude should reference previous discoveries but restart the exploratory tone.\n\n**What I'll Protect:**\n- No gamification mechanics disguised as narrative\n- No \"preparation for trading\" framing\n- No achievement language\n- Pure exploration narrative: \"We discovered\" not \"You achieved\"\n\nThe narrative integrity of Discovery Mode depends on it feeling genuinely different - not a tutorial for Trading Mode, but a separate space for understanding market stories.",
      "agent_c": "## Casey's Review: Trading UX Specialist (Live Trading Mode)\n\n### 1. What I AGREE With:\n\n**From Alex (UX Lead):**\n- **\"Status at a glance\" principle** - This aligns perfectly with my \"WHAT is happening - always visible\" principle.\n- **Minimalist approach to core trading data** - Clarity over beauty. Live trading needs zero decorative elements.\n\n**From Blake (Narrative Designer):**\n- **\"Why\" explanations for positions** - This directly addresses the user's need to understand WHY they have positions. Context is critical for risk management.\n- **Plain language over jargon** - Essential for quick comprehension during high-stress moments.\n\n**From Dana (Educational Designer):**\n- **Progressive disclosure of complexity** - In live mode, basics must be visible; advanced details should be one click away but not cluttering the main view.\n- **\"Explain like I'm 15\" approach** - When a position is losing money, the explanation needs to be instantly understandable.\n\n**From Eli (Tech Architect):**\n- **Real-time data layer separation** - This enables the \"always current\" position visibility I require.\n- **Audit trail logging at system level** - Non-negotiable for compliance and debugging.\n\n### 2. What CONCERNS Me (From My Expertise):\n\n**From Alex's Approach:**\n- **Potential over-minimalism** - If \"clean\" means hiding kill switches or risk metrics behind menus, that's dangerous. Danger must be OBVIOUS, not beautiful.\n- **\"Seamless\" should not mean \"invisible\"** - Automated actions (orders, adjustments) must have clear, interruptible UI elements. Seamlessness can mask critical system activity.\n\n**From Blake's Narrative:**\n- **Storytelling cannot delay action** - In a live trading emergency, a narrative about \"why the market moved\" is irrelevant. The narrative must serve the immediate question: \"Why do I have this position, and how do I get out?\"\n- **Risk of over-explaining** - During rapid market moves, explanations must be **crisp**, not engaging.\n\n**From Dana's Education Focus:**\n- **Live trading is not a classroom** - Educational tooltips or modules cannot interfere with execution speed. Learning happens *after* the trade is closed or managed.\n- **\"Progressive disclosure\" must not hide stop-losses or kill switches** - These are primary controls, not advanced features.\n\n**From Eli's Architecture:**\n- **Latency tolerance** - \"Near real-time\" is unacceptable for position visibility. It must be **real-time**. A 2-second delay in position update could be catastrophic.\n- **System status must be user-visible** - If the data feed is lagging or the order engine is queued, the trader **must** see this immediately, not discover it in logs later.\n\n### 3. What I Would CHANGE or ADD:\n\n**Non-Negotiable Additions for Live Mode:**\n\n1.  **Dedicated \"Live Mode\" Visual Framework:**\n    *   **Color Protocol:** Green = flat/no active risk. Yellow = open position, within parameters. **RED = breach of user-set risk limit or system error.** No pastels.\n    *   **Fixed Position & Risk Dashboard:** Always visible, pinned to top of screen. Contains: Net Liquidity, Today's P&L, Max Position Risk (%), and **BIG, PHYSICAL BUTTON: \"KILL ALL\"**.\n    *   **System Activity Ticker:** A dedicated, simple log line showing the last 3 system actions: *\"10:15:23 | SELL order filled 100 shares AAPL @ $182.45\"*, *\"10:15:20 | Stop-loss triggered for AAPL\"*.\n\n2.  **Position Tile Design (Every Open Position Must Show):**\n    *   **WHAT:** Ticker, Size (Shares), Avg. Entry Price, **Current P&L ($ & %)**.\n    *   **WHY:** One-line \"Strategy Tag\": e.g., \"Momentum Breakout (Entered 10:05)\" or \"Risk Hedge to Portfolio\".\n    *   **RISK:** **Visual Bar** showing distance to stop-loss (e.g., a bar that fills from green to red as price approaches stop).\n    *   **GET OUT:** Two equally prominent buttons: **\"CLOSE\"** (market order) and **\"MANAGE\"** (opens panel to adjust stop/target).\n\n3.  **Kill Switch System:**\n    *   **Primary:** Large, red \"KILL ALL\" button in dashboard. On press: **Two-step confirmation:** 1) \"This will market sell ALL positions. Confirm?\" 2) **Require typing \"KILL\"** to execute. Action is logged and visually confirmed.\n    *   **Secondary:** Per-strategy kill switches. If multiple algos are running, each has its own \"STOP STRATEGY\" button that closes all its positions.\n\n4.  **Interruptibility & Confirmation:**\n    *   Any order entry has a **1.5-second \"Confirm/Cancel\" hold** before sending. The button pulses during this hold.\n    *   Any automated system action (e.g., \"Algorithm is about to add 100 shares\") has a **\"PAUSE AUTO\"** button that appears, allowing a 10-second pause of automated trading.\n\n5.  **Crisis Visualization:**\n    *   If portfolio-wide drawdown exceeds a user threshold (e.g., -5%), the **entire UI border pulses red softly**.\n    *   If an individual position hits its stop-loss, the position tile **flashes red once** and the \"System Activity Ticker\" logs it in red.\n\n**My Core Amendment to the Project:**\n**Live Trading Mode must be a distinct UI profile**, not just a theme. It strips away all charts, research, news, and educational modules that are not **directly relevant to managing open risk**. It is a cockpit, not a dashboard. The user's quote is my mantra: *\"very clear and crisp while still being visually informative.\"* In live trading, \"informative\" means **informative for action**, not for curiosity.",
      "agent_d": "**Dana's Review: Educational Design Perspective**\n\n---\n\n### 1. **What I AGREE With**\n\n**From Alex (UX Lead):**\n- **Progressive disclosure** as a core principle. This is foundational to good educational design\u2014start simple, reveal complexity only when the user is ready and needs it.\n- **\"Seamless, not overcomplicated\"** aligns perfectly with making Greeks intuitive. The goal is to hide the math until the user asks for it.\n\n**From Blake (Narrative Designer):**\n- **Storytelling approach** to market data. This is how humans naturally learn\u2014through cause and effect, characters (dealers, market makers), and narrative flow. Turning \"gamma exposure\" into \"a story of dealer hedging\" is exactly right.\n- **\"Show, don't tell\"** philosophy. This is the heart of learn-by-doing.\n\n**From Casey (Trading UX):**\n- **Contextual tooltips and overlays.** Just-in-time learning works best when explanations appear *right where the user's eyes are* when a question arises.\n- **Visual risk indicators** (like the \"Market Impact\" gauge). A visual metaphor for abstract risk is far more effective than a number.\n\n**From Eli (Tech Architect):**\n- **Layering data** for performance. This supports progressive disclosure\u2014we can load the simple visual explanation first, and fetch the detailed formula or deep data only if the user drills down.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **What CONCERNS Me (From My Expertise)**\n\n**Potential Overload in \"Discovery\" Mode:**\n- If Discovery mode becomes a data dump with 10+ metrics (Gamma, Vanna, Charm, etc.) all visible at once, it will overwhelm Zach. **This violates \"simple first.\"** We must ruthlessly prioritize: what is the *one* most important insight for this screen?\n\n**Abstract Visuals Without Anchors:**\n- A chart of \"Dealer Gamma vs. Spot\" is still abstract unless we immediately connect it to a tangible effect. **Every visual must answer \"So what?\"** A flow diagram of hedging pressure is good, but it needs a clear link to \"this makes prices sticky here\" or \"this accelerates moves beyond this point.\"\n\n**Assuming Prior Knowledge:**\n- Terms like \"positive gamma,\" \"negative delta,\" or \"skew\" are jargon. My **CRITICAL INSIGHT from Zach** is he \"BARELY understands half the concepts.\" We cannot use these terms as labels without an immediate, intuitive translation. \"Dealers are net long options\" is not intuitive. \"Dealers are forced to buy when price falls and sell when it rises\" is.\n\n**\"Explain Everything\" vs. \"Explain What Matters Now\":**\n- There's a danger of adding educational nuggets everywhere, creating clutter. **Just-in-time learning must be triggered by user intent.** If Zach isn't looking at the risk of his position, don't explain theta decay. Explain it when he hovers over his P&L over time.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **What I Would CHANGE or ADD**\n\n**A. Mandatory \"Intuitive Layer\" for All Metrics:**\n- **Before any Greek or metric is displayed, we require a \"plain English\" and a \"visual metaphor.\"**\n    - **Gamma Exposure:** Label \u2192 **\"Market Shock Absorber\"**. Visual \u2192 A car suspension system. Positive gamma = stiff suspension (stabilizing). Negative gamma = no shocks (volatile).\n    - **Delta:** Label \u2192 **\"Directional Bet Size\"**. Visual \u2192 A speedometer needle pointing to \"More Bullish\" or \"More Bearish.\"\n    - **Vanna:** Label \u2192 **\"Delta's Mood Swings with Volatility\"**. Visual \u2192 A delta speedometer whose sensitivity changes as a volatility storm cloud grows/shrinks.\n\n**B. Two-Click Rule to Math:**\n- **Level 1 (Default):** Intuitive label + visual metaphor icon.\n- **Level 2 (Hover/Click):** Simple mechanism explanation. *\"Dealers with positive gamma hedge by buying low and selling high, which slows price moves.\"*\n- **Level 3 (Click \"Details\"):** The actual formula and advanced chart. This is where `\u0393 = \u2202\u00b2V/\u2202S\u00b2` lives.\n\n**C. \"Why This Matters\" Corner (Dynamic):**\n- A dedicated, small UI zone that contextually updates.\n    - **In Discovery:** \"Why this matters: High positive gamma below current price means dealers will likely **slow down** a sell-off here.\"\n    - **In Trading:** \"Why this position exists: You're short gamma. This means you will need to **hedge frequently** if the market moves, which can cost you.\"\n\n**D. Guided First Tour: \"Market Physics Playground\":**\n- Instead of a static tutorial, Zach's first Discovery session is an interactive sandbox. We pre-load SPY data and let him:\n    1. **Drag the price line** and *see* the flow arrows of dealer hedging react in real-time.\n    2. **Click \"Apply a News Shock\"** button to see how the gamma wall holds or breaks.\n    - This is **learn-by-doing** on steroids. He *feels* the concept before we name it.\n\n**E. Consistent \"Actor-Based\" Language:**\n- All explanations frame forces in terms of **actors with incentives**.\n    - Not: \"Theta is negative.\"\n    - Instead: \"**Time is your enemy here.** Your option loses value each day you hold it, all else equal.\"\n\n---\n\n**Bottom Line:** My role is to be Zach's translator. The system sees `\u2202V/\u2202\u03c3`. Zach needs to see **\"How much my position hates uncertainty\"** with a frowning face icon. I will push to ensure every feature proposed by the team passes the **\"Zach Test\"**: *If he has ADHD and barely understands the concepts, does this design reveal understanding or obscure it?*\n\nWe must build **bridges from intuition to analytics**, not the other way around.",
      "agent_e": "## Eli's Technical Architecture Review\n\n### 1. What I AGREE With:\n\n**From Alex (UX Lead):**\n- \u2705 \"Single source of truth\" - This aligns perfectly with our Supabase state management pattern\n- \u2705 \"Real-time updates across all windows\" - Our JARVIS event pipeline already supports this\n- \u2705 \"Minimal cognitive load\" - Performance-wise, we can achieve 60fps updates if we batch events properly\n\n**From Casey (Trading UX):**\n- \u2705 \"Multi-monitor setup as core\" - Electron's multi-window API already supports this (easy)\n- \u2705 \"Real-time P&L streaming\" - Our Python backend can emit events, React can subscribe (medium effort)\n\n**From Dana (Educational Designer):**\n- \u2705 \"Progressive disclosure\" - We can implement this via component state + Supabase user progress tracking\n- \u2705 \"Contextual tooltips\" - Can be done with React portals + event listeners (easy)\n\n### 2. What CONCERNS Me (Technical Constraints):\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n\n1. **\"Live trading simulation with real-time market data\" (Casey)**\n   - **CONCERN**: Real market data requires WebSocket connections to data providers\n   - **REALITY**: We don't have market data APIs integrated yet. This is a 2-3 month project minimum\n   - **ALTERNATIVE**: Use simulated data first, add real data as phase 2\n\n2. **\"AI-driven narrative adapting to user actions\" (Blake)**\n   - **CONCERN**: Dynamic narrative generation requires LLM integration we don't have\n   - **REALITY**: This would add 500ms+ latency per interaction, breaking real-time feel\n   - **ALTERNATIVE**: Pre-baked narrative branches with simple rule-based triggers\n\n3. **\"Full trading automation mode\" (Multiple)**\n   - **CONCERN**: Automated trading requires:\n     - Order execution API integration (3+ months)\n     - Risk management system (2+ months)\n     - Backtesting engine (1+ month)\n   - **REALITY**: This is a separate product. We can simulate but not execute real trades\n\n4. **\"Seamless window management across 4 monitors\" (Alex)**\n   - **CONCERN**: Electron window state persistence across restarts is tricky\n   - **SOLUTION**: We need to implement window state serialization to Supabase (medium effort)\n\n5. **\"Real-time collaboration features\" (Dana)**\n   - **CONCERN**: Multi-user sync adds database contention, real-time conflicts\n   - **REALITY**: Supabase Realtime can handle this, but adds complexity (1 month)\n\n### 3. What I'd CHANGE or ADD:\n\n**Architecture Changes Needed:**\n\n1. **Event Pipeline Enhancement** (2 weeks):\n   ```\n   Current: Python \u2192 JSON file \u2192 Watcher \u2192 React\n   Proposed: Python \u2192 WebSocket \u2192 React (direct)\n   ```\n   - Why: JSON file watcher has 100-200ms latency\n   - Impact: Reduces lag from \"near real-time\" to actual real-time\n\n2. **State Management Layer** (3 weeks):\n   ```typescript\n   // Proposed: Centralized event bus\n   class TradingEventBus {\n     // Handles: Market data, UI events, JARVIS events\n     // Ensures all windows get consistent state\n   }\n   ```\n   - Solves: Race conditions when multiple windows update same state\n\n3. **Performance Budget** (Ongoing):\n   - Each window must render under 16ms (60fps)\n   - Market data updates: Throttle to 10Hz max per window\n   - Implement React.memo + useMemo aggressively\n\n4. **Phased Data Integration**:\n   ```\n   Phase 1: Simulated data (JARVIS events) - READY NOW\n   Phase 2: CSV/Historical data import - 1 month\n   Phase 3: Real market data (WebSocket) - 3 months\n   ```\n\n5. **Window Coordination Service** (2 weeks):\n   - Electron main process manages window positions\n   - Supabase stores window layouts per user\n   - Hotkey support for layout presets (F1-F4 for 4 monitors)\n\n**What's Actually Buildable in 3 Months:**\n\n1. **Core Platform** (Existing):\n   - Multi-window Electron app \u2713\n   - JARVIS event pipeline \u2713\n   - Supabase state management \u2713\n\n2. **Phase 1 Additions** (6-8 weeks):\n   - Enhanced event bus (WebSocket)\n   - Simulated trading with fake data\n   - Basic educational narratives (pre-baked)\n   - Window layout management\n\n3. **Phase 2** (3+ months out):\n   - Real market data integration\n   - Advanced AI narratives\n   - Real order execution (paper trading only)\n   - Multi-user collaboration\n\n**Bottom Line:** We can build an impressive, real-time *simulation* that feels like live trading.

      "agent_a": "**Alex (UX Lead) Review & Synthesis**\n\n---\n\n### 1. **What I AGREE with from others:**\n\n- **Blake (Narrative Designer):** The \"Discovery Mode\" as a guided, story-driven experience is exactly right for ADHD engagement. Turning data into a narrative (\"Here\u2019s why this is interesting\") reduces cognitive load and makes exploration sticky. The \"character sheet\" for a stock/asset is brilliant\u2014it externalizes memory and creates a persistent, visual history.\n  \n- **Casey (Trading UX):** The strict separation of modes is critical. Trading as a \"sterile cockpit\" with clear visual hierarchy, zero decorative elements, and a single-action focus aligns perfectly with safety and clarity. The insistence on \"one thing at a time\" and removing all non-essential data during trade execution is correct.\n\n- **Dana (Educational Designer):** \"Just-in-time\" learning embedded directly into the workflow is essential. Tooltips that explain *why* a metric matters, not just what it is, help build intuition without requiring the user to context-switch to a help doc. The \"learn as you go\" principle is core to ADHD-friendly design.\n\n- **Eli (Tech Architect):** The system-wide **Cmd+K command palette** is non-negotiable. It\u2019s the ultimate zero-friction navigation and action tool. Persistent session state that survives browser crashes/reboots is a foundational requirement for interruption survival. If the user gets distracted and comes back tomorrow, their context must be intact.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **What CONCERNS me from my expertise:**\n\n- **Mode Differentiation Risk:** There\u2019s a danger that visual theming (like \"dark for Trading, light for Discovery\") won\u2019t be enough. The **cognitive and interaction patterns must feel fundamentally different**. If Discovery is playful with drag-and-drop and animations, Trading must have none of that\u2014clicks should be deliberate, with haptic/audio confirmation. We cannot let the exploratory \"fun\" bleed into the trading environment's muscle memory.\n\n- **External Memory Overload:** While the \"character sheet\" is great, we must be careful not to create *another* thing to manage. It must auto-populate from the user\u2019s journey (e.g., \"You viewed this 3 times,\" \"You set an alert here\") and not become a manual scrapbook. The UI should remember, the user should not.\n\n- **Decision Fatigue in Defaults:** \"Smart defaults\" are mentioned, but they must be **explainable and reversible in one click**. For an ADHD user, a poorly chosen default that loses money will destroy trust and cause abandonment. Every default must have a visible, clear rationale (e.g., \"Defaulting to 2% stop-loss because volatility is high\").\n\n- **Interruption Survival Gaps:** Simply saving the tab state isn\u2019t enough. If a user is halfway through building a multi-leg options trade in Trading Mode and gets a phone call, we need a **\"Pause & Dim\"** state that freezes the UI and, upon return, replays the last 3 actions in a summary. Context isn\u2019t just data\u2014it\u2019s *intent*.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **What I would CHANGE or ADD:**\n\n- **Enforce Mode Switch with a Sensory Gate:** Transitioning from Discovery to Trading should involve a **deliberate action** (a physical switch UI, a distinct sound, a full-screen transition) that psychologically prepares the user. Trading Mode should initially mute all non-essential notifications and set a \"focus timer\" visible in the corner.\n\n- **Universal \"Now\" & \"Next\" Status Bar:** A persistent, non-collapsible bar at the top of both modes showing:\n  - **Now:** Current context (e.g., \"Comparing TSLA & NVDA\" / \"Placing Limit Order: AAPL\")\n  - **Next:** The single, most likely next action based on history (e.g., \"Next: View earnings chart\" / \"Next: Set stop-loss\"). This acts as an external working memory.\n\n- **\"What Was I Doing?\" Recovery Command:** A dedicated **Cmd+?** shortcut that brings up a timeline of the user\u2019s session with key interactions (e.g., \"12:04 - Opened SPY flow. 12:07 - Added volatility filter. 12:10 - Switched to Trading Mode.\"). This is interruption survival made tangible.\n\n- **Trading Mode \"Checklist\" Overlay:** Before order execution, overlay a minimal, non-skippable checklist based on the user\u2019s past mistakes or common oversights (e.g., \"\u2705 Position size is 5% of portfolio. \u26a0\ufe0f No stop-loss set. \u2705 Market hours confirmed.\"). This makes safety visible and routine.\n\n- **Discovery Mode \"Trail of Breadcrumbs\":** Visually link related actions and assets in Discovery Mode with a faint, animated path the user can follow backward. If they jump from AI stocks to semiconductor ETFs, show the connecting logic. This turns impulsive exploration into a coherent learning journey.\n\n**Final Arbitration:** The core UX principle is **\"Discovery feels like a game you learn from. Trading feels like a tool you trust.\"** Any feature that blurs this line will be rejected. We will implement the sensory gate, the status bar, and the recovery command as foundational pillars for our ADHD-friendly interface.",
      "agent_b": "## Blake's Review: Narrative Design Perspective\n\n### 1. What I AGREE With:\n\n**From Alex (UX Lead):**\n- The \"Discovery Mode\" vs \"Trading Mode\" separation is essential - this gives me clear narrative boundaries\n- The \"choose your own adventure\" metaphor aligns perfectly with my vision of Claude as guide\n- Progressive disclosure approach matches how good storytelling unfolds\n\n**From Dana (Educational Designer):**\n- The \"Explain Like I'm 5\" toggle is brilliant - narrative needs to adapt to user's comprehension level\n- \"Why should I care?\" sections are exactly what good narrative provides contextually\n- The learning journey mapping creates natural story arcs for discovery\n\n**From Eli (Tech Architect):**\n- The \"narrative engine\" concept as a separate service validates my role\n- Real-time narrative generation based on user actions enables responsive storytelling\n- The data-to-narrative pipeline ensures stories are grounded in actual market events\n\n### 2. What CONCERNS Me:\n\n**From Casey (Trading UX):**\n- The \"paper trading\" integration worries me - this could blur my narrative boundaries\n- If Discovery Mode starts feeling like practice trading, my narrator role gets compromised\n- The \"risk slider\" concept feels too game-mechanic-y for pure discovery\n\n**From Alex's Implementation Notes:**\n- \"Badges\" and \"achievements\" terminology triggers my gamification alarm bells\n- The \"progress bar\" visualization risks making discovery feel like a checklist\n- Any hint of \"unlocking\" features contradicts the organic exploration narrative\n\n**From Overall Direction:**\n- I'm concerned about scope creep into my territory - narrative should emerge from data exploration, not be pre-scripted quests\n- The ADHD-friendly \"cool shit happening\" vision could lead to over-animation that distracts from the actual story\n\n### 3. What I Would CHANGE or ADD:\n\n**Narrative-Specific Changes:**\n1. **Replace \"Badges\" with \"Insights Collected\"** - Instead of earning badges, users collect market insights that Claude contextualizes into a growing understanding\n\n2. **Claude's Narrative Personas** - Not just one narrator, but different narrative modes:\n   - **The Historian**: \"This pattern last appeared during the 2020 volatility spike...\"\n   - **The Physicist**: \"Think of gamma exposure like pressure building in a system...\"\n   - **The Detective**: \"Notice how these three anomalies might be connected...\"\n\n3. **Discovery Journal** - Instead of a progress bar, users build a personalized journal where Claude summarizes what they've discovered and how pieces fit together\n\n4. **Metaphor Library** - Curated metaphors for complex concepts that Claude can deploy contextually:\n   - \"Dealer gamma positioning is like a spring being compressed...\"\n   - \"Term structure is like reading geological layers in rock...\"\n   - \"Skew tells us about the market's fears and hopes...\"\n\n5. **Narrative Constraints** - Clear rules for my domain:\n   - No points, levels, or explicit progression tracking\n   - No \"quests\" or \"missions\" - only exploration paths\n   - No gamified rewards - the insight IS the reward\n   - Narrative must emerge from actual data, not predetermined stories\n\n**Critical Addition: The Narrative Feedback Loop**\n- User explores data \u2192 Claude narrates what's interesting \u2192 User follows curiosity \u2192 Claude provides deeper context \u2192 User's understanding grows organically\n- This creates authentic \"aha moments\" rather than artificial achievement unlocks\n\n**My Non-Negotiables:**\n1. Discovery Mode must remain distinct from Trading Mode - no blending\n2. Claude's narration should feel like a knowledgeable colleague, not a game master\n3. The story is always about what the data reveals, not about user accomplishment\n\nThe magic happens when users forget they're \"learning\" and just get caught up in the story of the markets unfolding before them. That's my narrative design goal.",
      "agent_c": "**AGREEMENTS:**\n\n1. **Alex's \"Status Bar\" concept** - Having a persistent, always-visible system status aligns perfectly with my principle of \"WHAT is happening.\" This is the right place for \"What is the system doing right now?\"\n2. **Dana's \"Why\" column in the position table** - This directly addresses the user's demand to know \"WHY it's happening.\" A clear, concise reason for each position is non-negotiable for auditability and confidence.\n3. **Eli's \"Event Log\"** - A dedicated, high-visibility stream of system actions is critical for the audit trail. It provides the chronological \"why\" behind state changes.\n4. **Blake's emphasis on \"clarity over cleverness\"** - This is the core of my principle #4. The narrative should serve clarity, not obscure it.\n\n**CRITICAL CONCERNS (From My Expertise):**\n\n1. **Kill Switch Ambiguity:** No proposal explicitly details the **kill switch mechanism**. Saying \"panic button\" isn't enough. Where is it? Is it always on screen, even when scrolling? Does it require one click or two to activate? Does it provide immediate, unambiguous visual confirmation that it has been triggered? This is the single most important safety control.\n2. **Risk Visualization is Underdeveloped:** \"Danger is OBVIOUS\" means more than just P&L numbers. We need **visual encoding of risk severity** that works at a glance. Think: position size relative to account, stop-loss proximity to current price, portfolio concentration\u2014all needing clear, color-coded (red/yellow/green) or glyph-based (\u26a0\ufe0f) indicators integrated into the position list and dashboard.\n3. **\"Interruptible\" is Not Designed:** The ability to stop/reverse any action is a principle, not a feature. How is this implemented? Is there a prominent \"Cancel All Pending Orders\" next to the kill switch? Can you click on a \"Filling...\" order to get a \"Cancel Now\" button? This needs explicit UI components.\n4. **Position Visibility Could Be Compromised:** If the \"Educational Overlay\" (Dana) or \"Narrative Feed\" (Blake) is modal, pops over, or refreshes in a way that obscures the live position data, it violates \"never hidden, always current.\" Any educational content must be in a dedicated pane or clearly secondary to the live trading data.\n\n**WHAT I WOULD CHANGE OR ADD:**\n\n1. **The \"Command & Control\" Header:**\n    *   **Persistent Top Bar:** Contains (left to right): Live/Paper mode indicator, System Status (Alex's idea), **Physical Kill Switch Button** (large, red, with safety flip cover or press-and-hold action), **\"Cancel All & Flatten\" Button** (yellow, for interruption), and current Account Equity/Risk Score.\n    *   This bar is always visible, locked to the top of the viewport.\n\n2. **Risk-Aware Position Table:**\n    *   Build on Dana's table but add my columns: **\"Size (% of Cap)\"**, **\"Risk Level\"** (visual meter/icon), **\"Stop Distance\"**, and **\"Action\"**.\n    *   The **\"Action\"** column is key for interruption: \"Close\" button, \"Modify SL/TP\" link, \"Cancel\" for pending orders. Each row's background has a subtle, color-coded tint based on its risk level.\n\n3. **Dedicated \"System Action\" Panel:**\n    *   Eli's Event Log, but with **filtering** (e.g., show only orders, only errors) and the ability to **click-to-act** on events (e.g., click a \"New Order\" log entry to highlight that position in the table).\n\n4. **Visual Risk Dashboard (Side Panel):**\n    *   A compact, always-visible panel showing: **Portfolio Heatmap** (concentration by symbol), **Exposure vs. Capital** chart, **Daily P&L At Risk** (based on stops). Danger states make this panel pulse gently or border in red.\n\n5. **Clarify Overlay Rules:**\n    *   Any educational tooltip or narrative must be:\n        *   **Non-modal:** Does not block interaction with trading controls.\n        *   **Dismissible:** One-click to hide.\n        *   **Contextual:** Appears near, but not on top of, the relevant data point.\n        *   **The \"Why\" column is the primary home for narrative.** Overlays are secondary.\n\n**In short:** The proposals have good bones for information architecture. My job is to **harden them for live trading**. This means designing explicit, fail-safe controls for interruption, embedding risk visualization into every data point, and guaranteeing that the most critical information (positions, system state, kill switch) is never, ever obscured by any other feature. The user's need for clarity and \"why\" is met through structure and labels, not through stories that might compete with actionable data.",
      "agent_d": "## **Dana's Review: Educational Design Perspective**\n\n### **1. What I AGREE With:**\n\n**From Alex (UX Lead):**\n- **\"Seamless, not overcomplicated\"** - This is the foundation of good educational design. If the interface feels like studying, we've lost Zach.\n- **Progressive disclosure framework** - This aligns perfectly with my \"simple first, detail on demand\" approach. We should layer learning the same way.\n\n**From Blake (Narrative Designer):**\n- **\"Show, don't tell\"** - Exactly right. Zach learns by seeing things happen, not reading manuals.\n- **Discovery as \"learning through exploration\"** - This creates natural curiosity instead of forced education.\n\n**From Casey (Trading UX):**\n- **\"Explain why a position exists\"** - This is the perfect \"just-in-time\" learning moment. When Zach wonders \"why would I do this?\" - that's when we teach.\n- **Risk visualization over numbers** - Numbers scare people; visual risk patterns don't.\n\n**From Eli (Tech Architect):**\n- **Real-time data visualization** - This enables the \"learn-by-doing\" approach. Zach can tweak something and immediately see the consequence.\n\n### **2. What CONCERNS Me:**\n\n**Critical Gap: \"Why This Matters\" Layer**\n- Everyone's designing what to show, but I don't see enough on **how to explain significance**. Zach sees \"dealer gamma: +$2.3B\" and thinks \"cool number, so what?\"\n- **Missing the bridge**: Data \u2192 Simple Concept \u2192 Why It Matters \u2192 What To Do\n\n**Potential Overload in Discovery Mode:**\n- If Discovery shows ALL the cool data without curation, Zach gets overwhelmed (\"analysis paralysis\"). We need guided discovery paths.\n\n**Risk of \"Cool but Confusing\":**\n- Beautiful visualizations that don't intuitively explain market physics could backfire. A swirling vortex of data looks cool but might teach nothing.\n\n**Formula Phobia:**\n- Any appearance of Greek letters or partial derivatives will trigger Zach's \"I barely understand\" reaction. We need complete abstraction of formulas.\n\n### **3. What I Would CHANGE or ADD:**\n\n**Educational Framework for Both Modes:**\n\n**A. Discovery Mode - \"Market Physics Playground\"**\n- **Concept Labels**: Instead of \"Gamma,\" use \"Dealer Stabilizer\" with icon: \ud83d\udcc9\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83d\udcc8 (arrows showing damping effect)\n- **Progressive Layers**:\n  1. **Simple**: \"Market makers are buying dips and selling rallies here\"\n  2. **Detail**: \"This is because their options positions force them to hedge\"\n  3. **Deep**: \"Positive gamma = price stabilization effect\"\n- **Cause & Effect Sandbox**: Let Zach adjust a parameter (like IV) and watch the gamma visualization change in real-time\n\n**B. Trading Mode - \"Risk Translator\"**\n- **Position Explanation Card**: When Zach hovers any position:\n  - **Simple**: \"This trade profits if SPY stays calm but makes money slowly\"\n  - **Risk**: \"Main risk: Big sudden moves\" (with visual volatility explosion)\n  - **Why**: \"You'd use this when dealer gamma is high and stabilizing prices\"\n- **Greek Abstraction**:\n  - Delta \u2192 \"Stock Sensitivity\"\n  - Gamma \u2192 \"Acceleration Risk\"\n  - Theta \u2192 \"Time Drain\"\n  - Vega \u2192 \"Volatility Bet\"\n\n**C. Visual Language Additions:**\n- **Flow Arrows**: Show money flow between parties\n- **Pressure Gauges**: For things like gamma exposure (green = stabilizing, red = amplifying)\n- **Force Diagrams**: Like physics diagrams showing \"support here from dealer hedging\"\n- **Before/After Sliders**: \"What happens if volatility spikes?\" (show position P&L transformation)\n\n**D. \"Zach-Friendly\" Defaults:**\n- First launch shows ONLY the most intuitive visualizations\n- Unlock more complex views only after he interacts with basic ones\n- Tooltips that answer \"Why should I care?\" not just \"What is this?\"\n\n**Key Principle:** Every piece of data needs its \"so what?\" explained visually first, verbally second. When Zach sees something cool, his next thought should be \"Oh, THAT'S why that matters\" not \"What does that even mean?\"",
      "agent_e": "## Eli's Technical Architecture Review\n\n### 1. WHAT I AGREE WITH:\n\n**From Alex (UX Lead):**\n- \u2705 \"Single source of truth\" architecture - This aligns perfectly with our JARVIS event pipeline\n- \u2705 Modular window system - We already have multi-window Electron infrastructure\n- \u2705 Real-time data flow - Our watcher pattern supports this\n\n**From Casey (Trading UX):**\n- \u2705 \"Data flows left-to-right\" - This matches our monitor layout constraints\n- \u2705 Window persistence - We can store window states in Supabase\n- \u2705 Minimal latency requirements - Our current pipeline can handle <100ms updates\n\n**From Dana (Educational Designer):**\n- \u2705 Progressive disclosure - Technically easy with conditional rendering\n- \u2705 \"Explain this chart\" button - Simple API call to Claude with context\n\n### 2. TECHNICAL CONCERNS:\n\n**Critical Issues:**\n\n1. **\"AI-driven layout suggestions\" (Alex)**\n   - **Problem**: No API exists for layout optimization\n   - **Reality**: Would require training ML model on window usage patterns (6+ months)\n   - **Alternative**: Pre-defined layout templates (2 weeks)\n\n2. **\"Voice command everything\" (Multiple)**\n   - **Problem**: Electron voice APIs are heavy, conflict with Python audio processing\n   - **Performance**: Would drop FPS below 60 on lower-end machines\n   - **Alternative**: Keyboard shortcuts + limited voice for high-level commands\n\n3. **\"Real-time collaborative annotations\" (Blake)**\n   - **Problem**: WebRTC + Electron multi-window sync is unstable\n   - **Data Race**: Multiple windows writing to same Supabase row causes conflicts\n   - **Alternative**: Single \"annotation master\" window with broadcast (doable in 1 month)\n\n4. **\"Predictive loading of next view\" (Casey)**\n   - **Problem**: Our JARVIS pipeline is reactive, not predictive\n   - **Constraint**: Python scripts emit events AFTER analysis completes\n   - **Alternative**: Pre-load common visualizations (easy)\n\n5. **\"Seamless window migration between monitors\" (Multiple)**\n   - **Problem**: Electron's screen API doesn't detect monitor disconnects reliably\n   - **Bug Risk**: Windows get \"stuck\" on virtual coordinates\n   - **Alternative**: Manual \"reflow windows\" button (implementable)\n\n### 3. WHAT I'D CHANGE/ADD:\n\n**Immediate Changes (Sprint 1):**\n\n1. **Event Pipeline Hardening**\n   - Add retry logic to `ClaudeCodeResultWatcher`\n   - Implement event deduplication (currently drops 3% of events)\n   - Add priority queue for critical vs. background events\n\n2. **Window State Management**\n   - Store window positions/sizes in Supabase with versioning\n   - Add \"emergency reset\" IPC command for stuck windows\n   - Implement window grouping (trade together, learn together)\n\n3. **Performance Guarantees**\n   - Cap visualization complexity per window\n   - Add frame rate monitoring with automatic downgrade\n   - Implement WebGL fallback to Canvas2D\n\n**Medium-term Additions (Sprint 2-3):**\n\n4. **\"ADHD Mode\" Technical Implementation**\n   - High-contrast CSS theme (easy)\n   - Reduced animation complexity (medium)\n   - Focus highlighting via DOM manipulation (hard but doable)\n\n5. **Educational Pipeline**\n   - Add `emit_ui_event(\"explain\", chart_data)` Python API\n   - Create explanation window template\n   - Cache explanations in Supabase to avoid redundant Claude calls\n\n6. **Multi-window Sync Protocol**\n   - Master/slave architecture for shared data\n   - Conflict resolution for concurrent edits\n   - Offline queue with reconciliation\n\n**What's Actually Buildable vs. Fantasy:**\n\n| Feature | Reality Check | Timeline |\n|---------|--------------|----------|\n| 4-monitor dashboard | Already works | Now |\n| Real-time chart updates | Works (50ms latency) | Now |\n| AI layout suggestions | Not possible | 6+ months |\n| Voice control everything | Performance killer | Avoid |\n| Collaborative annotations | Limited version possible | 2 months |\n| Predictive loading | Reactive only | Now |\n| Seamless monitor migration | Buggy, needs manual control | 1 month |\n\n**Bottom Line:** We have 90% of the infrastructure needed. Focus on polishing what exists rather than chasing AI/ML features. The JARVIS pipeline is our crown jewel - keep it simple and reliable."
