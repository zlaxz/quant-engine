# [PROJECT_NAME] - Claude Code Configuration

**Last Updated:** [DATE]
**Current Phase:** [CURRENT_PHASE]

## STOP - READ THIS FIRST

Before doing ANYTHING in this project:

1. **Read `HANDOFF.md`** in project root - session state
2. **Understand the focus** - [FOCUS_ITEMS]
3. **Check the prohibitions below** - things you must NOT do

If you skip this, you WILL add noise that confuses future sessions.

---

## Current Focus ([MONTH] [YEAR])

### What We're Building
1. **[FOCUS_1]** - [DESCRIPTION_1]
2. **[FOCUS_2]** - [DESCRIPTION_2]

### What Phase We're In
- [COMPONENT_1]: [STATUS_1]
- [COMPONENT_2]: [STATUS_2]

### What's Next
1. [NEXT_1]
2. [NEXT_2]

## PROHIBITIONS (Do NOT)

These are constitutional - violating them creates noise:

| DO NOT | WHY |
|--------|-----|
| [PROHIBITION_1] | [REASON_1] |
| [PROHIBITION_2] | [REASON_2] |
| [PROHIBITION_3] | [REASON_3] |
| Ignore HANDOFF.md | It has current session state |

### Noise That Already Exists (Ignore These)
```
[NOISE_FILE_1]
[NOISE_FILE_2]
[NOISE_FILE_3]
```

## Architecture Summary

[ARCHITECTURE_EXPLANATION]

### How It Works
```
[ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM]
```

### Key Locations
| What | Where |
|------|-------|
| [COMPONENT_1] | [LOCATION_1] |
| [COMPONENT_2] | [LOCATION_2] |
| Session state | `HANDOFF.md` |

---

## Authoritative Documents

| Document | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| [DOC_1] | [PURPOSE_1] | [LOCATION_1] |
| [DOC_2] | [PURPOSE_2] | [LOCATION_2] |
| Session State | Current state | `HANDOFF.md` in project root |

---

## Session Workflow

### Start
1. Read this file (you're doing that now)
2. Read `HANDOFF.md` for session state
3. Confirm you understand the focus before proceeding

### During
- Stay focused on [FOCUS_ITEMS]
- [WORKFLOW_ITEM_1]
- Update HANDOFF.md if you make progress

### End
- Update `HANDOFF.md` with what changed
- [END_WORKFLOW_1]

---

## If You're Confused

1. Re-read the PROHIBITIONS section
2. [CONFUSION_HELP_1]
3. Ask [USER_NAME] before doing something that might be noise

---

**Focus: [FOCUS_SUMMARY]. That's it.**
